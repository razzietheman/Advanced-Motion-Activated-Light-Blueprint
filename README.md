# 🌟 Motion-Controlled Lighting 4.0 – The Next-Level Light Maestro 🌟

# ✨ Welcome to the Smartest, Most Flexible Home Yet

Imagine this:
You enter a room, and your lights already know what you want.
Morning light awakens gently, evenings wrap you in cozy tones, and motion, lux, sun, and schedule all work in perfect harmony.

Motion-Controlled Lighting 4.0 isn’t just an upgrade – it’s a full rewrite of your favorite automation, now smarter, safer, and more reliable:

🚶 Motion – Trigger lights with one or multiple sensors  
🔘 Optional Switches – Manual override at your fingertips  
💡 Lux Awareness – Only turn on when it’s truly dark  
🌅 Sunrise/Sunset with offsets – Perfect timing, every day  
🎨 Day & Night Scenes – Set your moods with scenes or individual lights  
⏰ Dual Fixed Off-Times – Lights always turn off on schedule  
📅 Workday Awareness – Weekday/weekend differences built-in  
🛡️ Failsafe Protection – Maximum runtime control for peace of mind  
📸 Snapshots – Preserve your preferred light states before activating  
📝 Logging – Keep track of every action


…and every feature is fully optional. You set the rhythm. You set the mood.  

# 🌅 Example Flows  
# 🌄 Morning Glow – Rise and Shine  

Weekday, 07:00. Motion triggers your gentle day scene.  
If the sun is already up, natural light takes over – no wasted energy.


# 🌞 Daytime Smartness

Sunrise/sunset offsets ensure your lights match the season and daylight.
Dual fixed off-times guarantee lights never stay on too long.
Want a late evening on weekends? No problem.

# 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode

Motion or a switch sets night mode: soft, relaxing light.
Lights fade off after your chosen auto-off durations – calm, not abrupt.

# ⏰ Workday vs Weekend Magic

Workday sensor integration makes your lighting routine-aware:
Longer evening scenes on weekends, early shutoff on workdays.

# 🛡️ Failsafe Protection

Forgot the lights? Don’t worry.
Failsafe ensures lights automatically turn off after the maximum runtime – now more robust and reliable than ever.
