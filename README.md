# Bathroom Motion Light Blueprint

---
## English

### Description  
Advanced blueprint for bathroom lighting using a motion sensor, separate day and night scenes, customizable schedules, adjustable lux threshold, and a failsafe timer.

This blueprint allows you to control your bathroom lights with a motion sensor, where you can have separate active times and weekdays for both daylight and nightlight scenes. It includes a failsafe timer that automatically turns off the light after a specified period without motion.

### Features  
- Separate schedules for daylight and nightlight scenes  
- Customizable active weekdays for each scene  
- Adjustable lux threshold to only turn on the light when it’s dark enough  
- Dynamic failsafe timer for automatic turn-off  
- Manual-friendly – won’t turn off lights you turned on yourself  
- Fully UI-configurable, no YAML editing required  

### Installation  
1. Import the blueprint in Home Assistant via the UI.  
2. Link your devices: motion sensor, light, lux sensor, and scenes.  
3. Configure times and lux threshold as you like.  
4. Save and enjoy smarter bathroom lighting!
