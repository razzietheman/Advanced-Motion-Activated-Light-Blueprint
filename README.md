# 🌟 Motion-Activated Lighting 3.7 – Your Ultimate Light Maestro 🌟

## ✨ Welcome to Your Smartest Home Yet

Picture this:  
You step into a room, and your home greets you with the perfect light.  
Mornings awaken you softly, evenings wrap you in cozy tones, and motion, sun, and schedule all dance in harmony.  

**Motion-Activated Lighting 3.7** gives you full control, full flexibility, full magic :

🚶 Motion – Trigger lighting with motion  
🌅 Sun Position – Reacts to sunrise/sunset with offsets  
💡 Lux Awareness – Only triggers when dark enough  
🎨 Day & Night Scenes – Create moods with lights or full scenes  
⏰ Dual Fixed Off-Times – Lights always turn off at exact times  
📅 Workday Control – Different behavior on weekdays & weekends  
🛡️ Failsafe Timer – Auto turn-off for peace of mind  
🔘 Optional Switch Inputs – Manual override whenever you want  

…and every feature is optional.  
You set the rhythm, moods, and automation rules.

## 🌅 Example Flows

### 🌄 Morning Glow – Rise and Shine  
Weekday morning, 07:00. You step into the kitchen.  
Motion triggers a gentle day scene – but if the sun is already up, natural light takes over instead.  

### 🌞 Daylight Awareness  
With sunrise and sunset offsets, lights adapt to long summer days or dim winter afternoons.  
Dual fixed off-times guarantee lights never stay on too long – e.g., 22:00 on weekdays, 23:00 on weekends.  

### 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode  
Motion or a switch sets night mode: soft, relaxing lighting.  
No motion? Lights fade off after your chosen timer – calm, not abrupt.  

### ⏰ Workday vs Weekend Magic  
Workday sensor integration makes your lighting routine-aware:  
Longer evening scenes on weekends, early shutoff on workdays.  

### 🛡️ Failsafe Protection  
Forgot the lights? No problem.  
Failsafe ensures lights shut off automatically after a max duration – with the option to toggle it on/off.
