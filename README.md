# 🌟 Motion-Controlled Lighting 5.2.6 – Robust, Flexible, and Scene-Aware 🌟

# ✨ Description

This isn’t just an automation – it’s a complete lighting brain for your home.
With Motion-Controlled Lighting 5.2.6 you get a solution that doesn’t just turn lights on and off – it understands scenes, accounts for sun, weekdays, lux levels, and makes sure no light is forgotten.

Built for robustness ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, easy troubleshooting, and maximum flexibility.

# 🚀 What’s New in 5.2.6

🎨 Off Scenes (Day/Night) – custom scenes triggered when lights turn off

💡 Auto-off with scene restoration – automatically restores previous lighting via snapshots

🛡️ Failsafe per category – main, day, night – only turns off if lights are truly on

🌙 Day & night brightness – dynamic dimming for the right atmosphere around the clock

📅 Weekday logic – fixed times and day/night can differ per weekday

📸 Snapshot handling – bring back your old lighting after automation runs

📝 Logging – full traceability in the logbook

# 🌅 Example Scenarios

# 🌄 Morning Start

07:00 on weekdays. Motion triggers the day scene or day lights.
Brightness is adjusted automatically.

# 🌞 Day Mode + Sun Control

Lights only turn on if lux level is low – no waste.
Can be combined with fixed off times.

# 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode

After night start, the night scene or night lights activate with dimmed lighting.
Fades out after the set duration if no motion is detected.

# ⏰ Workday vs Weekend

Lighting logic can differ between workdays and weekends.
Perfect if weekends should have calmer evenings.

# 🛡️ Failsafe

A safety net that only turns off lights if they are actually on –
and only if auto-off hasn’t already done its job.
