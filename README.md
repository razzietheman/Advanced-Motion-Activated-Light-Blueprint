# 🎨 Bring Your Home to Life

### 🌅 Morning Glow – Rise and Shine

It’s 7:00 on a weekday. You step out of bed.  
Motion sensors detect your movement, gently fading on lights in the kitchen or living room.  

If the sun is already bright, nothing happens – natural light does the work.  
The **day scene** is triggered and logged, so your home remembers it.  

### 🌞 Daytime with Sun Trigger

Lights can turn on automatically before sunset (with your **sunset offset**)  
Perfect for long summer afternoons when daylight starts to fade.  

Want a strict evening routine? The same lights can switch off automatically at **22:00** – no questions asked.  

### 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode

Motion sensors or manual switches trigger **night mode**.  
Lights fade on subtly, creating a calm, cozy atmosphere.  
No one moving around? No problem – lights fade off gradually after the set **light duration**.  

### ⏰ Workday vs Weekend Magic

Use a **workday sensor** to adapt lighting to your weekly schedule.  
Weekends? Lights can wait a bit longer to turn on… or stay off entirely. Your choice, fully automated.

# 🛡️ Never Forget: Failsafe

Left the lights on again? Don’t worry – the failsafe takes care of it.  
Lights gradually turn off automatically after a timeout, depending on the **last scene** and **light duration**.  
No more wasted energy, no more worries.
