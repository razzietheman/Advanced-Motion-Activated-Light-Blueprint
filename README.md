# 🌟 Motion-Activated Lighting 3.5 – Your Ultimate Light Maestro 🌟

# ✨ Welcome to Your Smartest Home Yet

Imagine this: you enter a room and your home welcomes you with the perfect light.
Evenings flow with warmth, mornings greet you gently, and motion, sun, and schedule all work in harmony.

Motion-Activated Lighting 3.5 brings you full control, full flexibility, full magic:

🚶 Motion
🌅 Sun Position
💡 Lux Awareness
🎨 Day & Night Scenes
⏰ Dual Fixed Off-Times
📅 Workday Schedule Awareness
🛡️ Failsafe with Activation Toggle

…and everything is optional. You define the rhythm, moods, and automation rules.

# 🎨 Bring Your Home to Life

# 🌅 Morning Glow – Rise and Shine

It’s 7:00 on a weekday. You step out of bed.
Motion sensors detect your presence, gently fading on lights in your kitchen, hallway, or living area.

If the sun is bright, no lights are triggered – natural light takes over.
The day scene is activated and logged, so your home remembers the last state.

# 🌞 Daytime with Sun Trigger

Lights can switch on automatically after sunrise or before sunset using your sun offsets.
Perfect for long summer days or cloudy mornings.

Dual fixed off-times ensure your lights never overstay their welcome, for example 22:00 on weekdays, 23:00 on weekends.

# 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode

Motion sensors or manual switches trigger night mode.
Lights fade on softly to create a calm, relaxing atmosphere.
No movement? No worries – lights fade off gradually after your set light duration.

# ⏰ Workday vs Weekend Magic

Use a workday sensor to tailor lighting to your weekly schedule.
Weekends? Lights can behave differently – longer durations, different scenes, or remain off entirely. Your home adapts automatically.

# 🛡️ Failsafe – Now with Activation Switch

Forget to turn off the lights? The failsafe timer has you covered.
Lights gradually turn off after a timeout, depending on the last scene and light duration.

And now you can enable or disable failsafe at will – giving you full control over automation safety.
