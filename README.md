# 🌅 Example Flows
  
# 🌄 Morning Glow – Rise and Shine  

Weekday, 07:00. Motion triggers your preferred day scene.  
If sunlight is already bright, natural light takes over – zero wasted energy.


# 🌞 Daytime Smartness

Sunrise/sunset offsets match the season and daylight.  
Dual fixed off-times guarantee lights never stay on too long.  
Late evenings on weekends? Fully configurable.

# 🌙 Evening Cozy Mode

Motion or a manual switch triggers soft night lighting.  
Lights fade out after your chosen auto-off durations – calm and natural.  

# ⏰ Workday vs Weekend Magic

Workday sensor integration adjusts lighting routines:  
longer, relaxed evenings on weekends; early shutoff on workdays.

# 🛡️ Failsafe Protection

Forgot the lights? No worries.  
Failsafe shuts lights off after max runtime, but only if they are still on – no conflicts with auto-off.
